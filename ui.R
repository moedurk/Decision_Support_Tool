                     or depredations.

                      The first plot indicates how many nest abandonments you can tolerate if you decide to use exclosures at the start of the season.
                      If you observe the indicated number of exclosed nest abandonments, the likelihood of a population decline becomes greater than if
                      you had taken no action (where the solid line exceeds the value of the dashed line). At this point, we recommend you reassess the
                      situation with updated data or pull exclosures.

                      number of nest predations, the likelihood of a population decline is higher than if you did use exclosures,  due to high incidence

                 endangered populations of Piping Plover (",span(em("Charadrius melodus")),").
                 However, exclosure use can result in adult mortality if adult predators key into
                 the presence of exclosures, or if adults are impeded from escaping predators.
                 Adult mortality is not always detected in the absence of a carcass, other signs
                 of mortality, or a nest camera. If one adult of a pair is killed, the remaining
                 parent sometimes abandons the nest as a result. In this scenario, it is not possible
                 to determine whether one or both adult plovers have died or have truly abandoned the
                 nest and are alive elsewhere, unless both adults are banded and are resighted quickly.
                 As a result, adult mortalities can be misclassified as true nest abandonments.
                 Exclosure use thus increases nest success by reducing nest predation but can
                 decrease adult survival rates, with unknown consequences for population growth rate.
                 Modeling efforts based on 1312 nests from the U.S. Atlantic Coast revealed unpredictable geographic and temporal variation in nest abandonment (and thus mortality) probability with exclosure use, thus the decision to use exclosures needs to be made on a site-by-site and year-by-year basis. Depending on the site and year, the risk of adult mortality from exclosure use can be outweighed by the increase in nest survival, in which case their use is prudent. In other cases, the adult mortality effects outweigh the benefit to nest survival, and exclosure use can have the opposite of the intended impact on populations. "),

               The population growth rates are calculated using average survival and fledgling estimates from the
               literature or expert opinion; if your site or region experiences different vital rates, this may affect
               the accuracy of the population growth estimates but will not affect whether using exclosures is better

               within a region. In general, a site is an area subject to a single management plan and experiencing
               largely similar environmental and anthropogenic conditions. If you wish to treat management units within a larger area as
               separate sites, then data for each unit needs to be run separately and will need to meet the minimum
               sample size criteria (discussed below). It will thus be preferable in most cases to combine adjacent
               management units to provide better estimates to inform the model, but if there are enough nests in each

               well flip a coin). With 10 nests the probability is 80%, and the probability continues to increase as
               sample size gets larger. To obtain the most reliable estimates, users should upload all available nest data (i.e. highest
